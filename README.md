# QuantumComputingIRCNoInternetNeededQ-
An IRC Hosted and Run in the Cosmos No Internet Is Needed and can Communicate Across Time and Space Freely

This code implements a quantum chat protocol using various quantum operations such as encoding, error correction, entanglement, and quantum key distribution. The chat protocol is implemented as an IRC-like system where users can send messages to each other. 

The `QuantumChat` operation is the main entry point which sets up the quantum register, encodes and transmits messages, applies error correction, and implements an IRC protocol. 

The `EncodeMessage` function encodes a given message as a quantum state using the `Encode` operation and applies a Pauli-X gate to each qubit corresponding to a '1' bit in the message. 

The `DecodeMessage` function decodes a quantum state by measuring each qubit and interpreting the results as a binary string, which is then decoded using the `Decode` operation. 

The `PrepareEncodedState` function prepares a quantum state by concatenating multiple encoded messages. 

The `ApplyErrorCorrection`, `Entangle`, and `Disentangle` functions apply various quantum operations to the quantum state to correct errors and enable entanglement. 

The `GenerateRandomKey` function generates a random key for use in quantum key distribution by preparing a qubit in the Hadamard state and measuring it. 

The `GenerateSharedKey` function generates a shared key between two parties by measuring two sets of qubits in the Bell basis and deriving the shared key from the resulting outcomes. 

The `EncryptMessage` function encrypts a message using a shared key by applying a quantum one-time pad. 

The `DecryptMessage` function decrypts an encrypted message using a shared key by applying the inverse of the quantum one-time pad. 

The `CreateIRC` function creates an IRC-like chat system by initializing a chat log and a quantum register for message transmission. 

The `SendMessage` operation sends a message from one user to another by encoding the sender, recipient, and message as a quantum state, applying error correction and entanglement, transmitting the state, disentangling and error correcting the received state, and decoding the message. 

The `GetChatLog` operation returns the chat log.

To run this Quantum program, you'll need to use a Quantum development environment that supports the Q# programming language, such as Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit. Here are the steps to run this program using the Quantum Development Kit in Visual Studio Code:

1. Install the Quantum Development Kit by following the instructions on the official website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quickstarts/install-command-line

2. Open Visual Studio Code and create a new folder for your project.

3. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code and create a new file with the extension `.qs`, for example `QuantumChat.qs`.

4. Copy the code from the previous answer and paste it into the new file.

5. Press `Ctrl+S` to save the file.

6. Open a new terminal window in Visual Studio Code by selecting `Terminal -> New Terminal` from the top menu.

7. In the terminal window, navigate to the folder where you saved the `QuantumChat.qs` file.

8. Type the command `dotnet run` to build and run the project.

9. The program will start executing, and you should see the chat log printed in the terminal window.

Note that you'll need to have the Quantum Development Kit properly installed and configured on your machine for this to work. You may also need to install additional dependencies, such as the .NET Core SDK, depending on your setup.

** TO RUN UPDATEDQUANTUMCHAT.QS 

To run the `RunQuantumChat()` operation, you will need to have the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit installed on your machine. 

Once you have the Quantum Development Kit installed, you can open the Quantum Development Kit command prompt, navigate to the folder where your code is located, and then run the following command to compile and execute the code:

```
dotnet run
```

This command will compile your program, execute the `RunQuantumChat()` operation using Microsoft's QuantumSimulator, and display the results.

Alternatively, you can use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to create a new Quantum project, copy the code into a new file, and then run the project using one of the IDE's built-in debugging tools.

Note that running quantum programs requires significant computational resources, and you may need to use cloud-based quantum computing resources or a high-performance quantum simulator to run the code effectively.
